----- The Game of Set -----
by Chris Manges

The Game of Set is a two player game where players take turns forming 'sets' of three cards based on certain criteria in the fastest amount of time. A card possesses four descriptors with three varying qualities.For example, a card can be red, green, or purple. The four descriptors are number of shapes, shape, shading, and color. Three cards form a set when each descriptor matches the other two OR when each descriptor is unique amongst the other two. Each descriptor must fit this criteria to be considered a set. A set is chosen by the active player by typing
#/#/#
where # is a valid number shown associated with the card with no repeating cards. If an incorrect format is submitted, you will be prompted to resubmit a valid response. If you submit a response that is not a set, you will be penalized 5 seconds. When a set is correctly chosen, it is replaced with three new cards until the deck is empty (begins at 69). The remaining cards will continue to dwindle until the final three cards are formed into a set. The game will then display the scores and declare a winner. If at any point you wish to quit the game, simply type 'quit' when prompted to enter a set.
